# vztridentAWD270-300
Based off of the Voron Trident in 300mm and the VZBot AWD and pbsuper's 235mm vztrident, this design is made from a voron trident frame with 10mm extension vertically and hevort z axis and vzbot 235mm awd gantry

a voron trident 300mm frame with a vzbot gantry! what's not to like?

Benefits over VZBot: 3 independent z ballscrews, allowing for tilt bed levelling

Benefits over Voron: much lighter gantry QuadXY motion system, originally from VZBot
