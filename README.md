# vztridentAWD270-300
Based off of the Voron Trident in 300mm and the VZBot AWD, this design is designed to be easily made from a Voron trident and a few extra components.

a voron trident 300mm frame with a vzbot gantry! what's not to like?

Benefits over VZBot: 3 independent z leadscrews, allowing for tilt bed levelling

Benefits over Voron: much lighter gantry QuadXY motion system, originally from VZBot
